# GraphJS-iOS

GraphJS-iOS is a Swift client-side library to help developers easily enable social features on their mobile apps. With only a few lines of code, you can easily add authentication, comments, messages, forum, groups, profiles etc. to your static web pages. 

## Getting Started

To get started with GraphJS-iOS, you need to include graphjs library as sources (via git-submodule for example) to your project. Then you can initiate it with ApiManager constructor. Cocoapods & Cathage support is planned

Example:
```swift
<script>
let graphJsApi = ApiManager({{PUBLIC_ID}}, {{GRAPHJS_HORT}}, )
</script>
```
